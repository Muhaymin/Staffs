            <h3>A reputation for quality</h3>
                <p>Our courses are Chartered Institute for IT (BCS) and Institute for the Management of Information Systems (IMIS) accredited. With this professional recognition, numerous industry partnerships, vocational relevance and a reputation for well-proven expertise, Staffs is widely acknowledged as the place to study your degree in computing.</p>
                <p>Employer engagement, work-based learning initiatives and student learning support were some of the areas highlighted for particular praise by external reviewers at the most recent quality audit and review of Staffordshire’s computing provision.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="content">
            <h3>Choose how you study</h3>
                <p>If you want to study Computer Science, Computing Science or Software Engineering, we’ve got plenty of options open to you.</p>
                <p>For starters, there are our two-year HNDs, 18-month Top-up (from HND) degrees and our three-year degree programmes (four-year if you choose to do a placement year). If you want to graduate more quickly, our Fast-track Computing Science degree can help you gain a BEng(Hons) in two years (three years with a placement) or MEng(Hons) in three years (four years with a placement).</p>
                <p>You can study part-time or full-time and, depending on your course, you can create your own degree pathway, combining core Computing areas with specialist subjects that you can choose yourself.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="content">
            <h3>Student support</h3>
                <p>Regardless of which course you choose, you’ll be supported by highly-qualified enthusiastic and friendly academic staff.</p>
                <p>The Faculty also has dedicated student advisors, as well as support from the University’s extensive student welfare network, so from tricky programming problems to student finance advice, there’s always someone here to help.</p>
                <p>You’ll be allocated a personal tutor in your first week to support you throughout your course.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="content">
            <h3>Experienced tutors</h3>
                <p>Study at Staffordshire University and you’ll be working with experienced staff who bring research expertise and industrial knowledge to their subject.</p>
                <p>We’ve got an active research team that’s at the forefront of developments in areas like Knowledge Management, Intelligent Systems, Mobile Computing and the application of technology to real-world problems (including RFID – Radio Frequency Identification).</p>
        </section>
        <section class="content">
            <h3>A flexible learning programme</h3>
                <p>Computing is a very wide field and we understand that sometimes it’s difficult to choose the right degree. Not least because you’ll study a large variety of new topics and you won’t know which areas interest you most until you’ve studied them.</p>
                <p>That’s why we design our degrees to give you flexible study options. In the first semester, it doesn’t matter which degree you choose: all students study the same Computing fundamentals. This gives you time to decide which branch of Computing is for you and you can then change between the degrees without any problem.</p>
                <p>To provide even more flexibility, you can transfer to Computing Science at almost any stage in your degree.</p>
                <p>On Computing Science, you study core Computing subjects but you also select combinations of modules to reflect your own interests, creating your own ‘pathway’. Most students study two or more pathways and you can choose from a very wide range of subject areas including Programming, Hardware, Web, Forensics, Networking, Information Systems, Mobile, Database and Multimedia.</p>
                <p>In the second year of your degree, you start to specialise. Depending on your course, you will study Software Engineering principles or Computer Science topics like Systems Control.</p>
                <p>In the final year, you’ll tackle more advanced subjects like Enterprise Applications with Java, Real Time Systems and Design Patterns. You’ll also complete a major project, which you’ll choose and manage yourself and which will involve creating a piece of software to solve a real world problem.</p>
                <p>Whichever course you choose, you’ll learn through a balanced mix of lab-based practical sessions, theory-based tutorials and lectures, and discussions with your tutors and fellow students.</p>
                <p>Our web-based Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) holds resources for your modules in one place, so that you can access them easily from a classroom or from home. </p>

            <h3>Placement opportunities</h3>
                <p>We always recommend taking advantage of our placement scheme, which could see you enjoying a year’s full-time paid work in a computing job.</p>
                <p>Our strong industrial links mean that we place around 200 Computing students a year. Our students are on placement with employers in the UK, Europe and even further afield. We regularly send students to organisations like Syngenta, Astra Zeneca, Hewlett Packard, GCHQ and Eurocopter. We typically place two students a year at CERN. Our Placements Unit has strong links with other European universities and represents the UK on the EUENET (European Working Party for Industry/Academic Co-operation).</p>
                <p>We’re not the only ones who recommend our placement scheme either — 90 per cent of our placement students surveyed in 2010 said they learnt a lot from the experience and over 93 per cent said they would recommend it to other students.</p>
                <p>Aside from being a really useful real-world education in Computing, a placement also gives you excellent future employment opportunities — a significant number of our students are offered jobs by their placement employers.</p>
                <p>If you prefer, you may even be able to use the placement year to develop and run your own company.</p>

        <section class="content">
            <h3>First-class facilities</h3>
                <p>The home of Computing at Staffs is the Octagon, a purpose-built facility which provides lecture theatres, labs, our research base and The Concourse (containing computers and study areas for student use as well as a wireless area with laptop ports).</p>
                <p>You can also use the networked computers and workrooms (and of course borrow books) at our 24-hour library. We have about 1,000 networked computers (around a third of which are upgraded every year), general purpose laboratories, specialist Games Programming labs, newly-opened Web Development labs, a secure Forensic Computing lab and Networking labs containing state-of-the-art equipment on loan from CISCO.</p>       
        </section>
        <section class="content">
            <h3>Career choices</h3>
                <p>The IT industry offers very good employment opportunities, and it’s a sector that’s continuing to grow, with increasing numbers of jobs.</p>
                <p>Our graduates have successfully gone into careers as computer scientists, software engineers, technical support engineers, embedded software specialists, application programmers, web designers, database administrators, IT consultants, systems engineers, systems analysts, project managers, analyst/programmers and technical support experts to name just a few.</p>
                <p>You’ll also have the option to study for a postgraduate qualification such as an MSc or a PhD.</p>
