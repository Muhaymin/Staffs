                <p>Data is a vital resource now and its protection against corruption, loss or theft is paramount.  Forensic computing focuses on the protection of systems and data from attack, the investigation where attack or misuse takes place and the recovery and reconstruction of data. </p>
                <p>You will also cover the legal aspects of Digital Forensics so that you will be able to present your findings as an expert witness.  Our graduates work for the police, home office and private companies plus other employers who need specialist protection.</p>

            <h3>Cyber Security</h3>
                <p>Individuals and organisations gaining improper access to supposedly secure data can be very costly for the owner both literally and figuratively - it can even be a matter of life and death especially when terrorism is involved.  Securing computer systems against spying, malicious attack or inadvertent damage is vital to any computer system.  You will learn how to protect systems by establishing secure systems from firewalls to cryptography.  Any organisation that uses the internet or has a computer network has a security problem and needs people with these skills.</p>

            <h3>Computer Networks and Security</h3>
                <p>Networks are vital to any modern organisation. Computer systems process and communicate a wide variety of data over networks. In turn, the safety and viability of commercial systems are continually under threat from malicious attacks or even inadvertent damage, which can undermine public confidence and fuel criminal activity. The component of a computer system that is most commonly exploited to breach the security of commercial systems is the computer network. Computer Networks and Security provides you with detailed technical knowledge and skills in both <a href="http://www.staffs.ac.uk/course/09G22000.jsp">computer networks and computer security</a> and should enable you to pursue a career in the areas of computer networking, computer security or network security.</p>

            <h3>Network Computing</h3>
                <p>Global business and everyday life are now linked through the internet and information technology changing the way we work, communicate and interact. From individuals using devices to watch television through the Internet via wireless networks to the operation of multinationals, there is an ever-increasing need for consumers and commercial organisations to have timely access to information, requiring data to be exchanged through an integration of information and communications technologies. The world wide web cannot exist without the supporting infrastructure of hardware network components and systems software. <a href="http://www.staffs.ac.uk/course/09G11000.jsp">Network Computing</a> seeks to develop your specialisation in the enabling technologies that underpin the Internet, Intranets and other computer-based information networks.</p>

            <h3>Computer Science</h3>
                <p><a href="http://www.staffs.ac.uk/course/09G59000.jsp">BSc(Hons) Computer Science</a></p>
                <p>If you want to work in computing but can't decide where or want to take advantage of the changing environment in computing this is the award for you. You will obtain the technical knowledge, skills and background to design, organise and support computer systems. Changing in partnership with the computing industry this award distinguishes itself from our other computing degrees by a greater emphasis on computer systems and the nature of computation. It stresses the hardware and operating systems of computers, how they are designed, built and supported giving graduates the skills to progress into software development or systems engineering.</p>
