			<h2>Web & Multimedia</h2>
                <h3>Why study Web and Multimedia at Staffordshire University?</h3>
                <p>Can you imagine a world without the Internet? It's an essential tool for everything from bargain hunting to doing business, keeping in touch, watching TV, downloading music and learning.</p>
                <p>Without web developers, designers and programmers, however, none of this would be possible online. So if you'd like a career pushing the Internet to new frontiers, our Web and Multimedia courses are ideal.</p>
                <p>At Staffordshire University, we'll train you to make the web accessible to all people, on all devices (our mantra is "Web for All"). Using all the latest programming languages, technology and know-how, you'll learn how to really exploit the web's (and your) full potential.</p>
